Sometime ever, sometime never.  
Don’t let the past steal your present.

No fear of words, no fear of years.  
Stars can’t shine without darkness.

Life is short and you deserve to be happy.  
Spend your life in your own way.

Time is that we do not come loose.  
Better to do something imperfectly than to do nothing flawlessly.

Treat yourself well.
